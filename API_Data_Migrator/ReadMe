The script:

1. Connects to secured APIs (basic auth)
2. Iterates through daily endpoints to retrieve JSON data
3. Cleans and merges CDR data with project information
4. Adjusts timestamps to Colombian timezone
5. Saves the final output to an Excel file
6. Migrates the transformed data into a **MySQL database** using SQLAlchemy
